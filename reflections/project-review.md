**The Third Space:Japanese American Resettlement in Greater Philadelphia**

This exhibit was originally designed to be an in-person exhibit at the Fleisher Art Memorial in South Philadelphia in Fall 2020. The venue closed due to the pandemic, so the exhibit creators decided to translate their exhibit into a virtual space. Rather than recreating the project in a stable, online digital exhibit website platform, the creators crafted a virtual reality exhibit venue using Unity software. The audience expanded with a virtual setting and the exhibit targets Japanese American citizens, Philadelphia residents and historians, political activists, digital artists, and those interested in immigration history and community development.

The exhibit was funded by the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) Legacy Fund and the National Park Service Japanese American Confinement Sites Grant. It was presented through the Japan American Society of Greater Philadelphia and the Da Vinci Arts Initiative.  The project falls under the scholarship of immigration history, movement studies, community formation, and political activism. 

The story of Japanese American resettlement is often overshadowed by the tragic stories of their forced relocation and incarceration during World War II. The exhibit creators aimed to shift the conversation into the hands of the Japanese American community itself by highlighting photos and objects that tell stories about their lives post-incarceration. The goal of the exhibit was to also inspire visitors to support refugee resettlement and an end to immigrant detention. The virtual exhibit space is designed to reflect a Japanese American incarceration camp. It is not a specific camp and not totally accurate, but it is representative of the aesthetics and feel of the camps. The choice to have it framed within an incarceration camp conveys ‚Äúthe lasting impacts of trauma‚Ä¶ which continues to influence the community‚Äôs artistic psyche to this day.‚Äù 

Visitors have a few options for exploring the exhibit: a YouTube video, playing online directly on the website, or downloading the exhibit to PC or MAC. I opted to download the program to my PC. When I was loaded into the exhibit, the navigation and design was so familiar to me I couldn‚Äôt help but think I was about to play Half Life 2. The webpage even used the language of video games by giving instructions on how to ‚Äúplay‚Äù the exhibit. The website provides simple instructions (WASD to move, mouse to click), but those familiar with the software would quickly discover other familiar game controls, like holding down shift to run. This type of exhibit might turn away visitors less comfortable with video game platforms, but the alternative viewing methods the designers presented help make it accessible for a wider audience with less technological knowledge. Using the downloaded version, I found my game lagging and freezing a bit. I have a gaming PC, although it‚Äôs a few years out of date now. Someone with an average PC or laptop might struggle to run this program. The exhibit itself is also rather large and each camp structure is fairly spaced out. You can run through the space which makes it less time consuming, but running through the space also feels inappropriate.

The design of the exhibit is straightforward but also engaging. The first two buildings feature films of the camps, followed by different structures dedicated to photographs of people and their artistic creations.  WRA content is parallel to community contributions. The sound paired with the exhibit also sets the mood. Visitors can hear the wind of the desert around them, and the design of the camp invokes a sense of loneliness and desolation. The atmosphere is a stark contrast to, for example, the building dedicated to the works of art the Japanese American community created. 

This exhibit was an innovative example of effective redesign during the pandemic. Its somber design conveys the lasting trauma of time in the camps on the psyche of Japanese Americans. It felt like visiting an exhibit, but given the software I was thinking of the possibilities of adding in NPCs that feature oral history recordings or stories that also help someone understand more about this community and their efforts to rebuild. A wider audience was able to engage with this exhibit after the redesign, and its digital presence is more permanent and accessible than a temporary exhibit at a physical space.
