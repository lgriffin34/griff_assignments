# Attend a workshop/event outside of class
### HIST 5152 Reflections Assignment

## About this assignment
Hands-on experience really is the best way to learn how to work with digital tools. We will work on small skills-oriented projects in our Lab during class, but this is a chance for you to engage with a topic or tool that is interesting or important to you personally in a structured, supportive environment.

### Due date
Due by November 28, 2022.

## Directions
1. Check out the Events calendar I've set up for this class to find a topic that you might be interested in. If you find one that isn't listed on the calendar, run it by me;  but it should be fine with me if you go to one of those, instead.
2. Once you've identified your event, make sure to register if necessary and check to see if you might need to prepare anything beforehand (sometimes, you might need to install some software or download a dataset or something along those lines to follow along in the workshop.) 
3. Then, make sure to attend it! Take notes along the way to help aid in your reflection process later.
4. Create a brief recap of the workshop/event answering the questions below.
5. Submit your materials.
  - Need a reminder about how to edit the document? [Directions are here.](https://github.com/HIST5152/assignments/blob/main/README.md#editing-the-documents)
  - Need a reminder about how to submit the document? [Directions are here.](https://github.com/HIST5152/assignments/blob/main/README.md#submitting-the-documents)

## Guidelines for the recap
The recap can take the form of a written essay, a video, a screen recorded demo, an infographic, blog post, or just about any other medium you prefer. In your recap, briefly explain (in no more than 1250 words/ 10 minutes):

1. The name, date, topic, organizer, and other basic details of the workshop.
2. The structure of the workshop: how was it organized (thematically, step-by-step, etc.)? Give details about any processes, lectures, or preparatory work that made up the workshop.
3. How was your experience? Did you learn something new? Were there things that frustrated you, and if so, how did you overcome them (or how might they be overcome next time)?
4. Did you come away with an example/prototype/work-in-progress? Include a link or screenshot if possible.
5. What advice would you give to someone else who might be interested in learning more about this same topic?

On Thursday, October 20th, the Kelly Writers House at the University of Pennsylvania hosted the talk, ‚ÄúFound Sounds: Bringing Lost Audio to Light,'' with guest speakers Ken Druker and Chris Mustazza. I was unable to attend the talk in person, but fortunately they live streamed the session. The session revolved around how to digitize, edit, and distribute archival sounds using the example of a previously-lost John Coltrane recording session and unreleased recordings of American poets. Druker is the Senior Vice President for Jazz Development at Verve Label Group and produced John Coltrane‚Äôs Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album. Mustazza is the Co-Director of the PennSound Archive and his work focuses specifically on the digitization and processing of previously unpublished poetry recordings. The host of the talk was Herman Beavers, professor of English and Africana Studies at the University of Pennsylvania. 

The talk had a casual structure, with the host (Beavers) mediating questions and directing the flow of the panel. While the live stream option was great, the session was hosted through YouTube and they were unable to play the recordings through the live stream due to copyright concerns. In a talk about audio, I really felt like I was missing an essential element. For one recording, the presenter joked that I would get emotional and they came back after laughing. I was left listening to the void. There was also a powerpoint presentation, but the live stream was set up so that the powerpoint presentation was a thumbnail and I was unable to read the text very clearly. 

Despite the technical limitations of YouTube and live streaming, the content of the session was very interesting. I love learning about audio, and I particularly enjoyed hearing the two speakers talk about the preservation and distribution process of their various audio. Both examples that the speakers talked about were previously lost audio pieces: a reference tape recording from Coltrane and TS Eliot narrating recorded by a linguistics lab at Columbia. People did not know of the existence of these recordings, and Beavers had a particularly good quote in reference to this fact. He said that ‚ÄúLost audio is a way for people who are marginalized and silenced in the larger society to be brought into the foreground sonically.‚Äù Both pieces are unfiltered, unprocessed, non-commercial recordings and yet they still have incredible value. Another great quote from the session that I noted was that ‚Äúthe idea behind found sounds is not just finding lost audio, but questioning how we make things accessible and how they catch context as they move through time.‚Äù 

The session was less of a workshop, and more a discussion about the found audio in question. PennSound primarily collects poetry recordings, and it was fascinating to consider the differences between approaching narrative vs. musical audio.Mustazza described PennSound as a ‚Äúmeta-archive.‚Äù This was my first encounter with this term, and based on his context he seems to mean it is an archives that actively collects other related collections. I would probably call that a thematic or curated archives, but perhaps he has his fingers on the pulse. A few questions touched on how they built their collection to which both speakers had different responses. Mustazza curates the archives, but Druker has to take into consideration the commercial value of his recordings because of his position within a record label. Despite the focus on commercialization, Druker stipulated that some of these lost sound tapes are not mixed or edited that heavily. He said the ear ‚Äúgets used to suboptimal recordings,‚Äù and both speakers stressed the benefit to appreciating these more raw recordings in their historical moment. They mentioned izotope technology in audio restoration which is something I am unfamiliar with and will have to research. 

Overall, it seemed like both of them were incredibly focused on distributing this content to the public, and this talk was a clear demonstration of that commitment. It was a really interesting presentation, but I didn‚Äôt leave with any definitive knowledge on software, tools, or archival processing used behind the scenes. If someone was interested in audio restoration, preservation, and cataloging, this talk really would not provide the needed content to actually do that hands-on work. I now know about PennSound, however, and will hopefully get a chance to check out their talks in the future.
